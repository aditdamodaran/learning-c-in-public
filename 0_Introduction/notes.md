# Introduction


## Main Takeaways:
The small size of C enables it to be learned quickly, although common library-type functions such as those used for arrays, lists, sets, etc. are absent. Functions of a C program exist in **separate** source files compiled separately.

C is typed, unlike its predecessors BCPL and B. The primary types are:
  * Characters
  * Integers
  * Floating Point Numbers

In addition, there are "derived data types" created with:
  * Pointers
  * Arrays
  * Structures
  * Unions

C is typed, unlike its predecessors BCPL and B. The primary types are:
  * Characters
  * Integers
  * Floating Point Numbers

In addition, there are "derived data types" created with:
  * Pointers
  * Arrays
  * Structures
  * Unions
  

Expressions are formed from "operators" and "operands". Any expression (including assignments and function calls) can be a statement.

We can control code flow with the usual statements: 
  * if-else
  * switch
  * while, for
  * do
  * break

Functions can be called recursively. Local variables are typically "automatic" / created with each invocation.

Functions of a C program exist in **separate** source files compiled separately. Variables can be:
  * internal to a function
  * external but scoped to the file
  * known by the whole program
